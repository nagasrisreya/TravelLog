DISCRIPTION - 

The Travel Log Website is a full-stack MREN (MongoDB, React.js, Express.js, Node.js) web application designed to help users explore and share travel experiences in an interactive and informative way. The platform enables users to browse travel logs, read reviews, and learn about various travel destinations through user-generated content.
Users can click on a travel log to get personalized insights, such as the distance from their current location, available modes of transportation to reach the destination, and recommended places to visit nearby. The homepage includes search functionality and filters by state to help users easily navigate the content.
The platform supports user authentication, allowing individuals to create, edit, and delete only their own travel logs. This ensures data integrity and content ownership. The user interface is built using Chakra UI, offering a clean, responsive, and modern experience.
Overall, the project serves as both a travel inspiration hub and a practical trip planning assistant, built with scalability and user experience in mind.

TRAVEL INFORMATION

When a user clicks on a travel log, a popup appears asking for their current location. Once entered, the app uses external APIs to fetch useful travel data. It calculates the distance and estimated travel time from the user's location to the travel destination using a mapping service like Google Maps. It also determines available modes of transportation (like driving, walking, or transit) supported by the API. Additionally, the app fetches popular nearby places to visit at the destination using a places discovery API. This personalized information helps users better plan their travel directly within the app.
